          <p className="mb-4">
            Traditional identity management systems rely on centralized authorities (governments,
            banks, and corporations) to issue, verify, and store user identities. This leads to
            several security and privacy risks, such as identity theft, unauthorized access, data
            breaches, and lack of user control over personal information. Moreover, users are often
            required to share more personal data than necessary for identity verification (e.g.,
            sharing an entire ID document to prove age).
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) allows users to control and share only necessary identity
            attributes without relying on third-party intermediaries. The challenge is to develop a
            mobile application that enables secure, identity verification while maintaining user
            privacy and control.
